We had the opportunity to be speaking again in JSConf Uruguay this year, and we decided to talk about functional reactive programming,
given that our Rehearsed Song component is written using FRP.

[JSConf Uruguay](http://jsconf.uy){:target="_blank"} was a great place to show what we're doing, because there was more than 350 assistants hearing our talk.

To prepare the talk we used ideas borrowed from different articles and talks that we want to share with you:

* [Elm Architecture Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial){:target="_blank"}
* [Cycle.js](https://github.com/staltz/cycle){:target="_blank"}
* [Introduction to reactive programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754){:target="_blank"}
* [2 minutes introduction](https://medium.com/@andrestaltz/2-minute-introduction-to-rx-24c8ca793877){:target="_blank"}
* [Reactive MVC and the Virtual DOM](http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom){:target="_blank"}
