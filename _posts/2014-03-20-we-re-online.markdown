Couple of months ago, we were having a problem: We don't have a cool way to share our rehearsals.

We started with email. Someone record the rehearsal, sent it via email, and later we start discussing, creating long and annoying conversations (We found the web version of gmail has a limit of 100 mail per conversation).

<!-- more -->

Then we continue using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), saving some MB from our email storage limit, but still having the problem of the long conversation.

If someone of the band wanted to find some specific comment, he/she need to read every single message of a conversation to find what he/she wanted. That's not cool!

Meet [Amplified](http://www.amplifiedapp.com), the best tool to enhance your rehearsals.

When you record a rehearsal, upload it to dropbox and we will take care of sorting the discussions for every rehearsal of every song.

Want to give us a try? just head to [http://www.amplifiedapp.com](http://www.amplifiedapp.com) and register for the private beta. We're giving access gradually to control the quality of the application. Be patient! We know that the wait will worth it.

And remember to follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/amplifiedapp) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/amplifiedapp).
